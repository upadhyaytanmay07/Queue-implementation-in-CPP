# Queue in C++
# Aim
To study and implement Queue operations in C++, including insertion (enqueue), deletion (dequeue), and traversal, and to understand how queues differ from stacks and arrays in terms of memory allocation, order of processing, and efficiency.

# Theory
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The element inserted first is the one removed first, similar to a real-life queue at a ticket counter.

A queue has two primary pointers:

Front → points to the first element in the queue.

Rear → points to the last element in the queue.

# Characteristics of Queues
FIFO Order: First element inserted is the first to be removed.

Linear Structure: Elements are arranged sequentially.

Restricted Access: Insertion happens at the rear, deletion happens at the front.

Overflow/Underflow: Overflow occurs when the queue is full; underflow occurs when the queue is empty.

# Types of Queues
Simple (Linear) Queue → Basic FIFO structure.

Circular Queue → Reuses empty spaces by connecting rear to front.

Double-Ended Queue (Deque) → Insertion and deletion allowed at both ends.

Priority Queue → Elements dequeued based on priority, not order.

# Algorithm

    Start
    
    Initialize front = -1, rear = -1, and define an array arr[SIZE].
    
    Display the menu with options:
    
    1 → Enqueue
    2 → Dequeue
    3 → Display
    4 → Peek
    5 → Check if Empty
    6 → Check if Full
    7 → Size
    8 → Clear
    9 → Exit
    Repeat until choice = 9:
    
    Read user’s choice.
    Case 1: Enqueue
    
    If rear == SIZE - 1 → print Queue Overflow.
    Else:
    If front == -1, set front = 0.
    Increment rear.
    Insert element at arr[rear].
    Print confirmation.
    Case 2: Dequeue
    
    If front == -1 OR front > rear → print Queue Underflow.
    Else:
    Print element at arr[front].
    If front == rear, reset front = rear = -1.
    Else increment front.
    Case 3: Display
    
    If queue empty → print Queue is empty.
    Else traverse from front to rear and print elements.
    Case 4: Peek
    
    If queue empty → print Queue is empty.
    Else print element at arr[front].
    Case 5: Check if Empty
    
    If front == -1 OR front > rear → print Queue is empty.
    Else print Queue is not empty.
    Case 6: Check if Full
    
    If rear == SIZE - 1 → print Queue is full.
    Else print Queue is not full.
    Case 7: Size
    
    If queue empty → size = 0.
    Else size = rear - front + 1.
    Print size.
    Case 8: Clear
    
    Reset front = rear = -1.
    Print Queue cleared.
    Case 9: Exit
    
    Print Exiting... and terminate program.
    Default
    
    Print Invalid choice.
    End

# Applications of Queues
CPU scheduling (Round Robin, FCFS).

Disk scheduling.

Data buffering (IO Buffers, Print Queue, Keyboard Buffer).

Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs.

Order processing systems (ticket booking, call centers).

Resource management in operating systems.

# Conclusion
Queues are essential for managing data in FIFO order.

They provide efficient handling of sequential processes like scheduling and buffering.

The experiment demonstrated:

Enqueue (insertion at rear).

Dequeue (deletion from front).

Traversal and utility functions (peek, size, isEmpty, isFull, clear).
This forms the foundation for advanced queue structures such as circular queues, deques, and priority queues.
Mastering queues is crucial for solving real-world scheduling, resource allocation, and graph traversal problems.
